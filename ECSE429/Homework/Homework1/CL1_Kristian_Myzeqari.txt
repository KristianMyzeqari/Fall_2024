Capabilities Explored and Findings:
--------------------------------------
1. Mind Map Creation and Node Management
Action: Created a complex mind map with over 50 nodes, including nested child nodes up to 4 levels deep.
Observation: The basic creation and management of nodes were stable. However, navigating between deeply nested nodes sometimes caused noticeable lag, especially when expanding or collapsing large branches.
Potential Instability: Performance degradation when dealing with highly nested nodes.

2. Linking Capabilities (URLs, Files, and Node Links)
Action: Added links to external websites, linked local documents (PDFs, images), and created links between nodes within the mind map.
Observation: All link types functioned as expected, opening files and URLs without issues. However, linking between nodes occasionally failed to maintain the correct target, particularly after rearranging nodes.
Potential Instability: Internal node links can break or misalign when nodes are moved.

3. Node Customization (Styling, Icons, Colors)
Action: Applied various styles to nodes, including font changes, color adjustments, and adding icons.
Observation: Styling was smooth and intuitive, but applying multiple styles (color, font, and icons) at once occasionally caused the application to freeze temporarily.
Potential Instability: Temporary freezing when combining multiple customizations rapidly.

4. Export and Import Functions
Action: Exported the mind map to HTML, PDF, and PNG formats. Imported existing mind maps created in earlier versions of FreeMind.
Observation: Exporting was mostly reliable, but larger maps resulted in slow export times, especially for PDFs. Some formatting inconsistencies were noticed when re-importing older maps, such as missing icons or altered styles.
Potential Instability: Slow performance and formatting issues during export and import of complex or older maps.

5. Search and Replace Functionality
Action: Used the search feature to find nodes by text and replace node content.
Observation: Search worked effectively in smaller maps, but on larger maps with 100+ nodes, search results lagged, and the replace function occasionally skipped nodes.
Potential Instability: Search and replace slow down significantly in large maps, leading to missed replacements.

6. Undo/Redo Stability
Action: Performed a sequence of actions (add, move, delete, style changes) and used undo/redo repeatedly.
Observation: Basic undo and redo actions worked, but complex sequences involving node movements and style changes sometimes led to unexpected results, such as incorrect node positions or partial undo of styles.
Potential Instability: Undo/redo behavior becomes unpredictable after complex sequences of edits.

7. Large Map Handling and Performance Testing
Action: Created a map with over 200 nodes, including extensive branching and cross-links between nodes.
Observation: Performance degraded significantly, with noticeable lag during node creation, movement, and expansion of branches. The application occasionally became unresponsive, requiring a restart.
Potential Instability: Severe performance issues and risk of freezing with very large maps.

Summary of Capabilities and Potential Instabilities:
1-Node Management Stability: Basic node functions are stable but degrade in performance with deep nesting.
2-Linking Capabilities: Stable for basic links; internal node links can misalign when nodes are moved.
3-Customization Instabilities: Combining multiple styling actions can cause temporary freezes.
4-Export/Import Issues: Larger exports are slow; re-importing older maps may alter formatting.
5-Search and Replace Performance: Slow and inconsistent results with large maps.
6-Undo/Redo Issues: Becomes unreliable during complex sequences involving multiple actions.
7-Large Map Handling: Major performance and stability issues when handling maps with a high number of nodes.

Recommendations for Improvement
1-Optimize Performance: Enhance handling of large and deeply nested maps to reduce lag and freezing.
2-Improve Link Stability: Ensure internal node links remain consistent after node movements.
3-Enhance Undo/Redo Logic: Make redo operations more predictable, especially after multiple edits.
4-Refine Export/Import Process: Address formatting and speed issues in exports, especially for complex or legacy maps.
